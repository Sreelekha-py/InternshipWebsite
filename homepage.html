																		  This website contains information for the COMP690, COMP890, 
																		  and DATA690 Internship Experience classes. In these classes, 
																		  students will be provided with field-based learning at a business, 
																		  non-profit, or government organization. Students will gain practical 
																		  skills relating to their major which will allow them to gain 
																		  insight into their potential career path, and will help them to build 
																		  professional connections in their field. Their 
																	      internship will also allow them to apply knowledge and skills acquired 
																		  through other coursework in the major to address and solve
